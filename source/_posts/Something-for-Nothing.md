# CLASS A RECYCLER

*我们都有我们的采石场。*

I've asked something, but I don't know if it's needed.
Love? Wealth? Or power? Even immortality?

But I don't even need them.

The only thing I want is peace.
That Inner Peace, that I haven't have in some a few thousands years.
The same time I spent in that quarry of silence, quarry of loneliness, quarry of blindness, quarry of material, quarry of nothingness.

But what did I owe?
What's its price?
And even, what is that particular thing?

So shall we have it.

我曾经寻求某物，而不知其是否是我所需。
爱？财富？权力？甚至是永生？
更别提宫殿和油井，钱和车，和随便什么了。

我不知道我是不是需要它们。

我想要和平和宁静。
那种内心的和平，哪怕我几千年以来都没拥有过。
在那静默的矿脉，那孤独的矿脉，盲目的矿脉，物质的矿脉，无物的矿脉中空耗的那几千年。

它的代价是什么？
我欠了什么？
甚至，它是什么？

所以我们应该拥有。
也不应该。
